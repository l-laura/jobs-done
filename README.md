# Mindfulness for Covid 19

This is an app for scheduling tasks related to mindfulness and health, and for keeping up with those tasks over the day. It is intended to keep up the good spirits during the Covid-19 lockdown.

The app is an entry for the Codevid-19 hackathon at TUM.

The UI is based completely on [Jobs Done!](https://github.com/skidding/jobs-done) by Ovidiu Cherecheș, credit to the good work!
